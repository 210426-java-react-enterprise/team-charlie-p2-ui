# Pantry.io
Pantry.io is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients in their pantry. Our application gives users the option to favorite recipes, keep track of the number of times they’ve prepared them, and schedule meal plans from their favorited recipes.  

Our goal is to create an application that inspires users to discover new recipes and organize them in a way that best suits their needs.

# Getting Started
Clone remote repository of the API onto your local repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/210426-java-react-enterprise/team-charlie-p2-api.git
```
If you want to have access to the user interface, make sure to clone:
```
https://github.com/210426-java-react-enterprise/team-charlie-p2-ui.git
```
It's important to note that our UI sends fetch requests to an API deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, however it may no longer be active.

Setting up the application.yml file:
```
api:
  app_id: [app-id-for-recipe-queries]
  app_key: [external-api-key-for-recipe-queries]
​
server:
  port: 5000
​
spring:
  application:
    name: spring-boot-poc
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
      path: /h2
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:test
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    username: admin
    password: revature
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    show-sql: true
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: none
​
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
​
jwt:
  header: Authorization
  prefix: Bearer
  secret: [secret-key]
```

Make sure to generate and use any secret-key of your choice! Furthermore, we used Edamam API 1.0 specifically in order to query for our recipes. Make sure to generate proper app_id and app_key values to put into the YAML file.

# Usage
Once you've cloned the API feel free to run the application locally. Our application has an internal Tomcat server that can be executed.

Next, if the Elastic Beanstalk server has been stopped, you may need to adjust the UI fetch requests to the specific link and port number of your local server.

From there you should be able to start the UI locally and begin pinging the API:
```
npm start
```
